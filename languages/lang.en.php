As the user moves, the system informs the resources that are available in the proximity, helping to access them. Two types of clients have already been implemented. One of them uses a tablet integrated into a motorized wheelchair, allowing users to be guided about resources around during the movements with the wheelchair. This prototype uses GPS to determine displacements in external areas. A specific hardware was integrated with the wheelchair to allow the detection of movements within buildings, using RFID cards placed on the floor. This integration also allows the user to control the wheelchair through the mobile device. The second prototype allows people with visual impairments to use their smartphones as a guide, allowing them to identify accessibility features and also the paths to be traveled to a specific location. In both prototypes, the connection of the clients on mobile devices with the server is carried out by the Internet, and any resources that offer this type of connection can be used.
